[The Matty Method](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HmJ1666IWWnvg60ryUAFgPve9PYaHa-QQcajt5wIy3Y/edit#gid=2123320753) was developed by [Matt King](https://support.google.com/profile/1863769). It approaches spreadsheet formulae from a functional standpoint, and entails investigating each individual function, one by one. 

This method excels at broadening one's breadth of functions and developing a vocabulary from which to approach formulae. It does not focus as much on interactions between functions or actually applying them; however, knowing what functions exist and expanding one's toolbox is extremely useful.
