Unstable functions, formulae, or techniques do not reliably store their outputs. Any technique that stores or produces information that becomes irretrievable once the technique ends is unstable. As a result, unstable techniques should only be used if the relevant information is temporary in nature (i.e. a dice roller).

The simple test for instability is whether deleting and then undoing that edit would revert the sheet to its previous state.
