# Welcome to the Astral Café.
This site hosts documentation for Google Sheets. It aims to include information that the [official documentation](https://support.google.com/docs/table/25273) may not cover. However, this does not mean it is comprehensive—it is just another resource.

If you wish to contribute to this site, you can find the Github [here](https://github.com/Astral1119/GSheet-Docs). The site and repository are both maintained by [Astral](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hIG_JbgGw7hbJmct2re2ySFZaC-LfrRA_IZN8Ghi2gY/edit#gid=1853561868).

> [!WARNING] Locale Consistency
> All formulae within are written for a North American locale. If you reside outside of North America, you may have to replace the `,` argument separator with `;` and the `,` horizontal [[Arrays#Array Literals|array literal]] delimiter with `\`.

> [!WARNING] This is for Google Sheets only.
> While some information here may be useful for Excel, a large portion does not transfer. If you are using Excel, consider using another resource.
