These are docs compiled by Astral for Google Sheets. It aims to include information that the [official documentation](https://support.google.com/docs/table/25273) may not cover. However, this does not mean it is comprehensive. It is just another resource.

> [!WARNING] Locale Consistency
> All formulae within are written for a North American locale. If you reside outside of North America, you may have to replace the `,` argument separator with `;` and the `,` horizontal [[Arrays#Array Literals|array literal]] delimiter with `\`.
